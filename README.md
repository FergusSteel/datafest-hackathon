Superbowl Data Analysis

Super Bowl Outcomes Analysis:
Calculate the average winning and losing points across all Super Bowls.
Create visualizations to show the distribution of point differences in Super Bowl games.
Analyze which teams have the most Super Bowl wins and losses.

MVP Analysis:
Determine which positions have produced the most Super Bowl MVPs (e.g., quarterbacks, running backs, defensive players).
Visualize which teams have had the most Super Bowl MVPs.

Attendance Analysis:
Analyze how attendance has evolved over the years. Are there any noticeable trends or fluctuations?
Compare attendance across different stadiums and cities.

Coaches Analysis:
Examine the Super Bowl records of different coaches. Which coaches have the most wins or losses?
Visualize the performance of coaches over time.

Super Bowl Ratings:
Analyze how TV ratings (average viewers, household rating, etc.) have changed over the years.
Explore the impact of different networks and compare ratings across Super Bowls.

Cost of Ads Analysis:
Investigate how the cost of a 30-second ad slot during the Super Bowl has changed over the years.
Compare ad costs with TV ratings to see if there's a correlation.

Player Performance - Fergus:
Analyze the performance of quarterbacks (QB) in Super Bowls. Are there any correlations between QB performance and Super Bowl outcomes?
Examine the impact of MVPs on their respective Super Bowl games.

Geographical Analysis:
Explore the geographical distribution of Super Bowl locations. Are there any patterns in terms of cities and states that host Super Bowls?
Analyze whether the location has any impact on attendance or TV ratings.

Referee Analysis:
Examine the performance of referees in Super Bowl games. Are there any referees associated with more controversial or eventful games?

Combined Data Analysis:
Consider merging data from the different CSV files to create a comprehensive dataset for more in-depth analysis. For example, you can combine Super Bowl outcomes, MVPs, and TV ratings to identify correlations.

Local team advantage:
Look at where the super bowl was hosted, which team was 'local team' and if the local team normally wins.

Predictions: look at regular season win %, or regular season win % after 7/8 weeks (to use current standings). Or look at points scored/conceeded (conceeded could be meaningful) difficult to do given difficult scoring patterns across eras

Split up teams into cold/medium/warm locations - if super bowl is hosted in a cold/warm location are they more likely to win?
